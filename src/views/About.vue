          Hello, I am Nina Verbeeke and welcome to my portfolio website! From an
          early age I have always been deeply interested in computing. This
          interest never left me, only growing more profound and passionate with
          every new discovery I made. I studied Creative Technology and
          completed a pre-master's degree in Technical Computer Science at the
          University of Twente. I have worked on a variety of projects that
          combined design, technology, and creativity. Some of the projects can
          be found on this website.
