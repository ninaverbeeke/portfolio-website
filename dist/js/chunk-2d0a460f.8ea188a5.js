On top of that, issues with intrinsic motivation among high school students are showing a steady increase over the years. Inquiry-based learning, in combination with current technological devices, has proven to create a comfortable and personal learning environment that could tackle the issue of low intrinsic motivation levels. A few prototypes were made in order to gauge whether high school students would accept a system that they need to interact with digitally, and physically. Evaluations with end users were conducted in order to test the acceptance and effectiveness of these prototypes. The end goal was to make high school students more motivated to learn about science subjects, and make learning more fun for them. To ensure high effectiveness and acceptance amongst high school students, they have been a large part of the research and have influenced the product design immensely. Based on evaluations, design choices were made that ultimately lead to the “ Molecules Game”, an interactive, educational playing board where students learn about how to build molecular structures. The playing board is connected to a computer screen that gives the users the task to build molecular structures by means of putting down atoms on the appropriate places on the playing board.
