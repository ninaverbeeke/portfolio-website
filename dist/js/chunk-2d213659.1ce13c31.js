In times of Corona, it is important that everyone understands exactly what is going on in the world around them and why it is happening. This installation aims to teach these children regarding the different aspects of the COVID-19 in a friendly manner and easy to understand for these children. The installation consists of a tabletop, of which the layout is inspired by the classic “city” carpet that can be found in most childhood bedrooms. The idea behind using the carpet is to make the audience feel comfortable with the installation, as they see something they are familiar with. The installation will cover a variety of topics, each contributing to a final message. This includes the basic understanding of COVID-19 (what it is, its origin and how it spreads) and the measures different governments have taken to prevent further spreading. Furthermore, the installation will also visualise what would happen if these measures were not taken, and provide an outlook of future prospects regarding the virus and how it affects daily life. To enhance the feeling of immersion, the ability to interact with the story will be added. The controllers provided with the VR set will enable the user to take various actions. One of these actions is the option to engage in a somewhat realistic dialogue with the NPCs (“Dora the Explorer”-style). The dialogue between NPCs will be voice recorded to alleviate the target audience from the burden of reading long pieces of text.
