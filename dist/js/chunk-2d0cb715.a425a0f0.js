For this project we were inspired by devices like the SkyCam to build a simpler version of a cable suspended flying system. The aim of this project was to produce a system that is capable of suspending the artworks made by EXOOT above their spectators. EXOOT is a company based in Utrecht, the Netherlands, that performs with interactive objects and installations at festivals and art events. The final product is a construction of wires and pulleys with servo motors to control the movement of the suspended object. The motors can be controlled using an application on a smartphone or by a physical controller. The artwork can be controlled by a person or autonomously over a prefix path.
