Reviewed studies into the topic of inventory management demonstrate that enhancing an organization's inventory management can significantly improve the quality of the outcome of business performance. The literature review confirmed that data analytics can be used to enhance information extraction and decision-making in inventory management. A design process was developed to outline the phases that were followed in this graduation project. The design process of this graduation project consists of five phases: (1) Empathise, (2) Ideate, (3) Converge, (4) Realize, and (5) Evaluate. Stakeholders were actively involved in each of these phases. In this research, a tool was developed for analysing and visualizing data in order to derive value from inventory data. Such a system is expected to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of handling inventory. In addition, it allows automating several processes within a company. The proposed tool was implemented and evaluated at AEMICS, an electronics design and manufacturing company.
